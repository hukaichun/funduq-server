"""Liveness and readiness, as two endpoints rather than one.

They answer different questions and a single endpoint gets one of them
wrong. *Live* means this process is running and its event loop is turning —
if that is false the only useful response is a restart. *Ready* means it can
serve: the database answers and is at the migration this code was built
against. A database blip must not restart every replica, which is exactly
what happens when a liveness probe touches the database.

Both are unauthenticated, because a probe cannot hold a credential — so
neither says anything a stranger should not see. `Souk.health` is careful
about that (no connection string, no driver message); this file adds no
detail of its own.

What "ready" means is core's judgement, not this layer's — see Health.ready.
All that happens here is a status code.
